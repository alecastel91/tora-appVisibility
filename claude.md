## Recent Updates (November 10, 2025)

### Booking System Improvements
- **Compact Booking Cards**: Reduced card size and spacing in BookingsScreen for better visual density
- **Date Badge Display**: Added day-of-month number badge to each booking card (top-right corner, 32px square)
- **Past Date Validation**: Prevent creating offers with dates in the past - alert popup shows if attempted
- **Decline with Reason Modal**: When declining offers, users can now provide an optional reason via textarea modal
- **Improved Spacing**: Reduced month/year header spacing to match card gap for better visual hierarchy

### Critical Database Configuration
**IMPORTANT**: The backend MUST be connected to **local MongoDB** (`mongodb://localhost:27017/tora`), NOT MongoDB Atlas.

The booking offers, profiles, and all application data are stored in the local MongoDB database. If the backend is connected to Atlas, all booking data will appear missing.

**Backend Environment (.env)**:
```
MONGODB_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/tora
```

**Common Issue**: Multiple backend server instances can cause port conflicts. If bookings disappear:
1. Check which process is listening on port 5001: `lsof -i :5001`
2. Kill all backend processes: `pkill -f "node.*server.js"`
3. Restart backend: `cd tora-backend && npm run dev`
4. Verify connection shows: `✅ MongoDB Connected: localhost`

### Booking Offer System
- **Offer Cards in Chat**: System messages with `dealId` display as interactive booking offer cards
- **Message with Emojis**: Booking offer previews include emojis (💰 fee, 📅 date, 📍 venue) for better scanability
- **Calendar Star Icon**: Booking offer cards show calendar icon with star overlay
- **Decline Reasons**: Optional reason textarea when declining offers from BookingsScreen
- **Date Badges**: Day number displayed on each booking card for easy chronological scanning

## Recent Updates (November 11, 2025)

### Currency and Fee Input Improvements
- **Fixed Currency Rounding Precision**: Resolved floating point precision errors that caused 300 USD to be stored as 299.93 USD
  - Applied `Math.round(parseFloat(fee) * 100) / 100` rounding to all fee inputs
  - Affects: MakeOfferModal (initial offers) and ChatScreen (counter-offers)
  - Ensures accurate currency values across all currencies (USD, EUR, GBP, JPY)
- **Integer-Only Fee Input**: Changed fee input fields to only accept whole numbers
  - Changed `step="0.01"` to `step="1"`
  - Changed placeholder from "0.00" to "0"
  - Added `min="0"` to prevent negative values
  - Backend rounding still ensures precision if decimals somehow get through

### Decline Flow Improvements
- **Required Decline Reason**: Made decline reason mandatory when declining from BookingsScreen
  - Alert shows if user tries to decline without providing reason
  - Removed "(optional)" text from modal
  - Consistent with ChatScreen decline behavior
- **Improved Modal Readability**: Increased transparency/opacity for better contrast
  - Textarea background: 0.05 → 0.12 (140% increase)
  - Textarea border: 0.1 → 0.15 (50% increase)
  - Focus background: 0.08 → 0.15 (87% increase)
  - Placeholder text: 0.3 → 0.4 (33% increase)
  - Modal background: Changed to solid #1a1a1a for better contrast
- **Decline Messages in Chat**: Declining from BookingsScreen now sends proper chat message
  - Creates system message with decline card showing venue, date, and reason
  - Message includes event name in subject: "Booking Offer Declined: {eventName}"
  - Notification sent to other party
  - Message appears in both conversation lists with preview text
- **Correct Person Attribution**: Fixed "Declined By" to show actual person who declined
  - Checks `dealStatus.declinedBy` field instead of message sender
  - Shows "You declined offer" when current user declined
  - Shows "{Name} declined offer" when other party declined
  - Example: Al Jones declines → MOVE sees "Al Jones declined offer", Al Jones sees "You declined offer"
- **Backend Population**: Added `.populate('declinedBy')` to both GET /api/deals endpoints
  - Ensures declinedBy field includes full profile object (name, role, avatar)
  - Fixes issue where "Declined By: Unknown" was showing

### Message Preview Cleanup
- **Removed Emojis from Conversation List**: Message previews no longer show emojis and details
  - Added `previewText` field to Message model for clean previews
  - Booking offers show: "New Booking Offer: {eventName}" (no emojis or fee/date details)
  - Accepted bookings show: "Booking Confirmed! {name} accepted your offer"
  - Full details with emojis still visible inside chat conversation
  - Backend API returns `previewText` instead of full `text` for conversation list

  - Message integration for representation request flow
