/**
 * Celebrations: what we mark, and how we notice.
 *
 * The rule: celebrate completions the member CAUSED, never arrivals. An offer
 * landing in your inbox is an inbox event — the bell and the Bookings dot are
 * the right weight for it. Celebrating incoming things teaches people to
 * ignore the animation, and then the moments that should feel rare don't.
 *
 * Two ways a celebration starts:
 *
 *  1. A badge became earned. Badges are DERIVED server-side (no stored
 *     "earned at"), so there is no event to listen for — we notice by diffing
 *     the computed set against a small per-profile record of what this device
 *     has already shown.
 *
 *  2. One of three action moments fired, raised at the action site.
 *
 * Both render through the same overlay, so the app has one celebration, not a
 * collection of effects.
 */

/**
 * "Has this device already shown X?" — the one mechanism both detectors use.
 *
 * Returns null when nothing was ever recorded, which is what distinguishes a
 * genuinely new member from one whose history predates this feature. Writes
 * MERGE rather than replace: the deals list is paginated, so a milestone that
 * scrolls off the newest page must not be forgotten and celebrated again.
